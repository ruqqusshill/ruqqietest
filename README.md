Thanks for checking out RuqqieNav! 
This is my first attempt at an open source app, it provides a slide-out navigation drawer combined with a swipe to refesh Webview giving you a quick-access list 
of the most common links you'll need and generally making navigating around the mobile site of Ruqqus.com more convenient.

This is made using Kotlin in Android Studio and I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time.
If you see anything ridiculous please open an issue and I will pretend to know how to fix it.
If you want to assist or contribute please feel free. Speaking of free - this app is ad free, uses the minimum required permissions and doesn't offer any IAPs. 

Don't forget to check out ruqqus.com !
