This is my first attempt at an open source app and provides a simple navigation drawer combined with Webviews to show a list 
of quick links from the slide-out menu and generally speed up browsing around the mobile site of ruqqus.com 
("speed up" is not meant in relation to page loading speeds, but rather the overall quickness that the slide out navigation hopefully adds to get around the site).

This is made using Kotlin in Android Studio.

I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time, if you see anything ridiculous please open an issue and I will pretend to know how to fix it.
If you want to assist or contribute please be aware that I know as much about github as I do about writing apps.

Most importantly, don't forget to check out ruqqus.com !
