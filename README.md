Thanks for checking out RuqqieNav! 
This is my first attempt at an open source app, it provides a slide-out navigation drawer, swipe to refesh, bigger buttons for fat fingers and thanks to some help from the RuqES script creator enefi, it now uses some custom CSS styling for posts and comments. 
The slide-out nav drawer contains the most common links you'll need and generally makes navigating around the mobile site of Ruqqus.com more convenient. 

This is made using Kotlin in Android Studio and I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time.
If you see anything ridiculous please open an issue and I will pretend to know how to fix it.
If you want to assist or contribute please feel free. Speaking of free - this app is ad free, uses the minimum required permissions and doesn't offer any IAPs. 

Don't forget to check out ruqqus.com !
