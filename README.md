This is my first attempt at an open source app and provides a slide-out navigation drawer combined with Webview to show a list 
of quick links and generally speed up navigating around the mobile site of ruqqus.com 

This is made using Kotlin in Android Studio and I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time.
If you see anything ridiculous please open an issue and I will pretend to know how to fix it.
If you want to assist or contribute please feel free. Speaking of free - this app is ad free, does not need location permissions and doesn't offer any IAPs. 

Don't forget to check out ruqqus.com !
